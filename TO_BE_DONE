This is a reminder, no particular order in the list:

.- add the new ace_admin template on tool.twittermometro.com
.- add the main page template on twittermometro.com (probably the
template Unify https://wrapbootstrap.com/theme/unify-responsive-website-template-WB0412697 )
.- add the login through Twitter (to be discussed)
.- add the possibility to add tweets to the corpus (on lead or nolead) just for the administrator (or a particular user)
Can we define this user in an easy way?
.- how can we include the top filters on the new template?
.- refactor the code to improve the class division.
.- refactor the code to separate the corpus treatment in a module? file?. this is to be able to add in the future
other types of lead calculation.
.- make the system multilingual (spanish and english)
